# Bandhive - Band Booking Management System

Bandhive is a Django and React-based web application developed as part of my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) Final Year Project (2022â€“2025) at Rajagiri College of Management and Applied Sciences. It streamlines the connection between music bands and event organizers by providing a centralized platform for registration, booking, and management.

## About the Project

Bandhive is designed to simplify band booking and management with the following key objectives:
- **For Bands**: Register, create profiles (genre, pricing, availability, media), and manage bookings.
- **For Customers (Event Organizers)**: Browse verified bands, check availability, and book with transparent pricing and secure payments.
- **For Admins**: Manage user verification, oversee transactions, and resolve conflicts for smooth operations.

The system enhances traditional manual processes with real-time booking management, an integrated payment gateway, WhatsApp-based communication, and a feedback/review system to ensure trust and transparency.

## Features

- **Band Registration & Verification**: Bands create profiles, verified by admins to ensure authenticity.
- **Customer Registration**: Event organizers sign up and manage bookings.
- **Band Member Management**: Bands add and manage team member details.
- **Event Booking & Approval**: Customers send requests; bands accept or reject based on availability.
- **Secure Payment System**: Implements advance payment functionality via a dummy PhonePe gateway integration.
- **Notifications & Messaging**: Real-time updates and WhatsApp-based communication.
- **Feedback & Reviews**: Customers rate and review performances, moderated by admins.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, bookings, payments, and generate analytical reports (e.g., booking trends, payment summaries) to support data-driven decisions.

## Tech Stack
